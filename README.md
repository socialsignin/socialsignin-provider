SocialSignin Provider Modules
=============================

SocialSignin Provider Modules are thin wrappers around the corresponding Spring Social Modules which allow
applications easy access to their chosen API clients for a number of common use-cases. 

This reduces the need to work with the lower-level connection apis of spring social when an 
application wants to to deal with APIs directly rather than connections to APIs. 

The modules also enable configuration of provider-specific components from Spring-Social and Spring-Social-Security
to to registered easlily and simply simple component scanning.
